          <p>Chinups are very effective boosters of upper body growth. They workout the muscles of the upper back (latissimus dorsi), shoulders (posterior deltoid), arms (biceps), and forearms (brachialis). Chest muscles get activated a little bit, too. In chinups the palms face you, while in pull ups the palm face away from you. Pull ups employ teres minor (one of the four rotator cuff muscles) more than chin ups do, therefore, if your rotator cuff is hurting do only chin ups—you don’t want to injure rotator cuff muscles and their tendons.</p>

          <p>The dip exercise activates primarily the triceps. It’s a basic movement that works all three parts of this muscle group. It also targets the anterior deltoid, the chest muscles and the rhomboids in the back. The dip allows you to load your triceps as no other exercise. The problem with the dip is that it overstresses the shoulder muscles, the pecs, and the elbows. If you have troublesome shoulders, you should skip this exercise. The injury risk can be minimized if one limits the range of motion.</p>

          <p>A traditional upper body exercise for most body builders, the barbell shrug targets the trapezius. The movement is short, but the result is big. A large trapezius makes a big difference in your appearance. Muscles in the middle and lower back (romboid, erector spinae) and abdomen (obliques, rectus abdominis) are also involved to a lesser extend. To avoid injury, do not rotate your shoulders while shrugging.</p>

          <p>The dumbbell shoulder press targets specifically the shoulders. Unlike the barbell press, the dumbbell press does not involve as much the triceps and chest, allowing you to focus on your shoulders. Many people prefer the barbell over the dumbbell press because they can lift more weight with the barbell. But what they fail to understand is that the barbell actually works, to a significant degree, their upper chest and triceps, not their shoulders. I saw a significant increase in my shoulders size when I switched from barbell to dumbbell presses.</p>

      <h2>Pec Deck Flies</h2>

          <p>Including chest flies in a list of Fast Muscle Building Exercises flies on the face of conventional knowledge. Chest flies target the muscles of the chest. But so do other more compound exercises (i.e barbell bench press). Why choose chest flies? It’s believed that chest flies, like other squeezing movements (i.e cable crossovers) can stimulate chest growth more effectively than traditional press movements because they exert resistance that is directly opposite to the natural pec function, which is to pull the upper arm across the body right above the midline (adduction). Presses, on the other hand, are more of a front delt and triceps exercise and as a result fail to fully engage the pectoral muscles. In support of this argument, there are bodybuilders who attribute their huge pecs to squeezing movements, like the chest flies, rather than pressing movements. The muscle growth I experienced after using chest flies as my main chest exercise for the last 3 months, is higher than the growth I saw after 5 years of bench pressing. Impressive.</p>

      <h2>Dumbbell Bench Press</h2>

      <!--Body content-->
          <p>The bench press is one of the best exercises for the upper body. On the downside, it poses injury risk because it overstresses the shoulder. In addition, the press move involves the triceps and shoulders so the pecs are not hit directly. Still, it is a compound movement that when performed properly can greatly stimulate muscle growth. Using dumbbells is better than using a barbell because dumbbells offer freedom of motion that can accommodate rotator cuff’s particular mechanical requirements. Doing dumbbell presses on the floor instead of on a bench ensures that at the lower part of the motion your elbows do not move below your shoulders, which would overstress the rotator cuffs and deltoids.</p>

          <p>Doing barbell curls is probably the fastest way to grow the most famous muscle in the human body— the biceps brachii muscle. Other exercises, such as the dumbbell curls, hammer curls, cable curls, concentration curls, supinated bent rows, and chin ups, do not target the biceps as directly as the barbell curl. The barbell curl is the most “compound” bicep movement of all employing all bicep muscles. When performing this exercise do not swing your torso, otherwise you are allowing momentum, not your biceps, to lift the weight for you.</p>

      <!--Body content-->
          <p>The close grip bench press is the safest and more effective triceps exercise you can do as it activates the whole tricep muscle. It involves the chest and shoulder muscles in addition to the triceps. Unlike the dips, it does not pose a threat for the shoulders. Use a narrow grip but do not grasp the bar with your hands less than 4 inches apart otherwise you could hyper-adduct the wrist joint. Load the bar and press hard.</p>

          <p>For a thick and wide back, you need to do cable rows. This exercise hits the upper back (trapezius), and the middle back (latissimus dorsii) giving the upper body that V shape. The biceps and forearms are strengthened, too. Seated rows develop the lower back (spinal erectors) as well, because this part of the body is in constant tension during the movement.</p>
