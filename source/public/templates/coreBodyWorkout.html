          <p>The deadlift is regarded by many as the king of mass builders. And for a good reason since it works more muscles simultaneously than any other strength training weight lifting exercise. It effectively adds slabs of muscle to the lower and upper body. When properly executed it is risk free. It employs and strengthens over 25 major muscles including those of the entire back (lower, middle, upper), the shoulders, abdominals, forearms, hips (gluteal muscles) and the legs (hamstrings and quadriceps). The deadlift is a true measure of somebody’s strength. The deadlift world record is 1,015 lb by Benedict Magnusson.</p>

      <h2>Bent Over Row</h2>

      <!--Body content-->
          <p>It’s been called “Back Thickener” because it stimulates the growth of the entire back. It employs 8 major muscles in the lower, middle, and upper back. The bent over position also calls for the involvement of your abs (rectus abdominis and obliques) to stabilize your core region. It’s relatively difficult to perform bent over rows, which is why it is an overlooked exercise. To avoid injury you must keep the back straight, not rounded, and your trunk tight. A pronated (ovehand) grip increases the activation of the shoulder muscles while a supinated (underhand) grip places the emphasis on the lats and biceps. The problem with the bent over row is that while your back may be strong enough to row the weight, you may not be able to lift it because you just can’t stay balanced. The weight pulls you forward.</p>

      <h2>Barbell Squat</h2>

      <!--Body content-->
          <p>Barbell squats are excellent for increasing muscle size not only in the legs but in the whole body. Doing heavy squats triggers a systemic anabolic effect that promotes overall muscle growth. The squat employs mainly the quadriceps (quads), hamstrings and the gluteus maximus. It also involves the hip adductor (inner thigh) and other stabilizer muscles. There is some injury risk involved though, even if you do the exercise the right way. Placing a heavy barbell on your shoulders creates an unhealthy vertical compression on the spine. Moreover, in the lower part of the motion, knee injuries are common. To avoid knee injury, make sure your knees do not move beyond your toes. Other than that, heavy squatting guarantees rapid muscle growth.</p>

      <h2>Barbell Lunges</h2>

      <!--Body content-->
          <p>Barbell lunges are an excellent, safer, alternative to barbell squats. Lunges work each leg separately but fully. When performing lunges, a big part of the resistance comes from your own body weight. Therefore the exercise requires relatively little weight on the barbell. If you do barbell squats with 240lb, it is unlikely you can lift more than 150lb on a barbell lunge. That means lunges are less taxing on your spine. In addition, since your knee does not travel beyond your toes, lunges are safer for your knees than squats.</p>

      <h2>Leg Press</h2>

      <!--Body content-->
          <p>When compared to squats, the leg press is a less compound movement. The leg press is performed from a seated position and therefore it employs fewer muscles than the squat. It’s easier and safer, too, because it is performed in a fixed pane of motion which requires minimal core stabilization. That means, your abs and back muscles are not that much involved. The relatively short hip Range of Motion (ROM) decreases the involvement of the hamstrings and glutes thus placing the emphasis on the quads. Still, the leg press is superior to the squat in that it can more directly target the quads. With the hip adductor (inner thigh) and stabilizer muscles less involved, and the seat support, the leg press allows you to focus all your energy on your quads and hit them really hard with a tremendous load.</p>

      <h2>Bench Press</h2>

      <!--Body content-->
          <p>The bench press is a great muscle builder, which is mistakenly called “the King of chest exercises”. For many, it is the index of one’s total body strength. While it does activate big muscles in the upper body including the triceps, shoulders and chest muscles, it is by no means the most effective exercise for chest development, contrary to what most people have been told. First, it does not fully contract the pectoral muscles because your hands are still far apart at the point of full flexion. In fact, the barbell bench press misses the contraction almost entirely. There are other exercises, such as the cable crossover or the butterfly machine (chest flies) that fully contract the pectoral muscles because they bring both hands to the middle of the body. Secondly, the bench press stretches the shoulder muscle so excessively that it can damage shoulder cartilage. Still, the barbell press, if performed properly, it is a great muscle builder because it involves the largest muscles of the upper body. But don’t expect it to do on your chest the work that will do on your triceps and delts. To avoid injury, do not bring the bar to the point it touches your chest. Stop when your arms are parallel to the ground.</p>

      <!--Body content-->
          <p>If you want a strong mid section, the barbell rollout is one of the best exercises you can do. While more conventional exercises, like sit ups and leg raises, are popular as well, they involve the hip flexors too much. This takes the focus off of your abs (the rectus abdominis). The barbell rollout, instead, works mainly the rectus abdominis. The isometric, static contraction during the rollout thoroughly strengthens the core abdominal muscles.</p>

      <h2>Bicycle Crunches</h2>

      <!--Body content-->
          <p>According to a study by San Diego State University, among the most common abdominal exercises, bicycle crunches are the best ab exercise you can do, in terms of muscle activation. Crunches are effective, safe, and free. Don’t let the TV ads convince you to buy any bulky contraption that will take up room in your closet. Of course, crunches alone will not make your abs ripped. Proper diet along with resistance training and aerobic exercise are more important than ab exercises in sculpting the sought after 6-pack.</p>
